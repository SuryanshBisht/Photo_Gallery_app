I'd recommend to checkout my github profile SuryanshBisht
as I'll keep updating this project there.
This was my first time working on a backend based project with django 
which is why I had to rely on bootstrap and django crispy form for designing:P


Setup Instructions:
1. open the folder Photo_Gallery in your local environment
2. open windows powershell and run the following commands to install the required dependencies (skip if already installed )
pip install django
pip install django-crispy-forms
pip install Pillow
3. to run the application at localhost enter the following command
py manage.py runserver

Features:
1. My photo gallery app allows a user to upload and view any number of images
   he wants on the gallery page.
2. Every added photo must belong to a category which can be used to filter them
   later on in the gallery 
2. Multiple user support!
